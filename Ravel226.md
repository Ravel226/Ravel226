### 👋 Hey, I'm Maako — I teach machines to think and networks to defend themselves

## 🧠 What I'm Building

I'm knee-deep in my PhD, exploring how **Large Language Models can revolutionize Network Intrusion Detection**. Think of it as teaching AI to be the ultimate security guard—one that actually understands what's happening, not just pattern-matching like it's 2015.

**Current Mission:**

- 🔬 Researching LLM architectures for real-time threat detection and analysis
- 🤖 Developing **Nylah** — my JARVIS-inspired AI assistant (she's getting scary good)
- 🛡️ Merging cybersecurity fundamentals with bleeding-edge AI to build systems that actually work in production
- 📚 Learning offensive security techniques to think like attackers (know thy enemy, right?)

## 🎯 The Intersection Where I Live

Most people pick a lane. I built a highway between **AI** and **Security**.

Why? Because the best defense isn't just knowing the rules—it's understanding the game at a level machines are just beginning to grasp. LLMs don't just see patterns; they can reason about them. That's the future of security, and I'm here to build it.

## 🚀 Projects That Keep Me Up at Night (In a Good Way)

### 🤖 **Nylah** — My AI Companion `[In Active Development]`

> _"JARVIS, but make it yours"_

Building an advanced AI assistant that goes beyond chat. Natural language understanding, task automation, multi-modal capabilities, and a personality that doesn't feel like talking to a refrigerator. She's not just responding—she's thinking.

**Status:** Private repo. Coming soon. Trust me, it's worth the wait.

### 🎯 **RAG-Fusion with GPT-4o**

Experimenting with hybrid retrieval strategies to make AI actually remember what it reads. Domain-specific knowledge injection without hallucinations. The goal? Context that doesn't just stick—it understands.

### 👁️ **Drowsiness Detection System**

Real-time computer vision for driver safety. Built with YOLO for facial landmark detection. Because falling asleep at the wheel shouldn't be an option.

### 🤖 **Auto Jobs Applier**

AI-powered job application automation. Because manually filling out 50 applications with the same info is a crime against productivity.

### 📊 **GPT Fine-tuning Pipeline**

Custom framework for domain adaptation of LLMs. Data quality, eval metrics, and making sure your model actually learns what you want it to.

### 🔄 **N8N Workflow Automation**

Building intelligent automation systems that connect everything—Gmail, Telegram, Drive, Slack. If it's repetitive, I'm automating it.

### 🌐 **F2F Translation**

French to Fongbe translation tool. Preserving language and culture through tech.

## 💭 Philosophy

> _"The best security systems don't just react—they understand. The best AI doesn't just process—it reasons. I'm building both."_

I believe in:

- **Learning in public** (even the failures)
- **Security through understanding**, not obscurity
- **AI that augments humans**, not replaces them
- **Open source** when possible, **closed source** when necessary
- **Coffee** ☕ (non-negotiable)

**Currently jamming to:** Whatever keeps the code flowing 🎵

**Status:** Probably debugging something or teaching Nylah a new trick

**Fun fact:** I once debugged a network security issue that turned out to be the router was not even connected 😑
